# Kafka Elasticity

Apache Kafka supports adding and subtracting brokers to respond to changes in demand. However, this must be done carefully. This repo demonstrates the steps required to expand and shrink a Kafka cluster.

Confluent has re-architected Apache Kafka to offer cloud-native elasticity in Confluent Cloud. Compare the steps here to the experience of using Confluent Cloud, which supports autoscaling for basic and standard clusters, and a 1-click scale up/down experience with dedicated clusters.


## Initialize Cluster and Topic

### Start Cluster

```
docker compose up zookeeper broker1 broker2 broker3 -d
```

### Create Topic

Create topic `test`.
```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-topics \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
        --create \
        --topic test \
        --partitions 8 \
        --replication-factor 3
```

Describe the topic.

```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-topics \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
        --describe \
        --topic test
```
### Produce

Produce to topic `test` in a terminal on the left.

```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-producer-perf-test \
        --topic test \
        --num-records 50000000 \
        --record-size 100 \
        --throughput 1 \
        --producer-props bootstrap.servers=broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093
```

### Consume
Consume from topic `test` in a terminal on the right.

```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-console-consumer \
        --topic test \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093
```


## Steps to Add a Broker

### Start Broker

```
docker-compose up -d broker4
```

### Manually Reassign Partitions (with throttle)

Check where partitions are placed. Notice Broker 4 doesn't serve any of this traffic.
```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-topics \
    --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
    --describe --topic test
```

Create a json file to specify topics you want to rebalance. Notice only one topic is specified (what if you have 1000 topics?).
```
echo '{"topics": [{"topic": "test"}],"version":1}' > topics-to-move.json
```

Generate a reassignment plan. Notice you don't know the load is evenly balanced amongst partitions, so you would need to measure that to make smarter decisions about partition placement.
```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-reassign-partitions \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
        --topics-to-move-json-file /tmp/reassignment-files/topics-to-move.json \
        --broker-list "1,2,3,4" \
        --generate \
    > ./reassignment-files/reassignment.json
```

The reassignment plan `./reassignment-files/reassignment.json` should look like this:
```
Current partition replica assignment
{"version":1,"partitions":[{"topic":"test","partition":0,"replicas":[1,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":1,"replicas":[2,3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":2,"replicas":[3,1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":3,"replicas":[1,3,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":4,"replicas":[2,1,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":5,"replicas":[3,2,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":6,"replicas":[1,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":7,"replicas":[2,3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]}]}

Proposed partition reassignment configuration
{"version":1,"partitions":[{"topic":"test","partition":0,"replicas":[1,4,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":1,"replicas":[2,1,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":2,"replicas":[3,2,4],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":3,"replicas":[4,3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":4,"replicas":[1,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":5,"replicas":[2,3,4],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":6,"replicas":[3,4,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":7,"replicas":[4,1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]}]}
```

Open the file  `./reassignment-files/reassignment.json` and edit it so it only includes the â€œProposed partition reassignment configuration" in JSON (i.e., just the last line).

The resulting file should look like this:
```
{"version":1,"partitions":[{"topic":"test","partition":0,"replicas":[1,4,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":1,"replicas":[2,1,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":2,"replicas":[3,2,4],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":3,"replicas":[4,3,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":4,"replicas":[1,2,3],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":5,"replicas":[2,3,4],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":6,"replicas":[3,4,1],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]},{"topic":"test","partition":7,"replicas":[4,1,2],"log_dirs":["any","any","any"]}]}
```

Execute the reassignment plan with throttling set to 1MBps.

```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-reassign-partitions \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
        --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment-files/reassignment.json \
        --execute \
        --throttle 1000000
```

Verify the throttle has been set.
```
docker compose exec broker1 \
    kafka-configs \
        --describe \
        --bootstrap-server broker1:29091,broker2:29092,broker3:29093 \
        --entity-type brokers
```

### Remove throttle

## Steps to Decommission a broker
### Pick a broker to decommission (don't kill the controller!)

### Find out the partitions for which that broker is the leader

### Manually Reassign Partitions (with throttle)

### Remove Throttle

### Gracefully kill broker
